      <p>
        Completing code challenges, bite-sized problems that can be solved with
        code, is an excellent way to sharpen specific coding skills and concepts
        — not to mention, code challenges are fun. In honor of Pride Month this
        June, we’re giving you a list of code challenges to try that all relate
        to uplifting the LGBTQ+ community and its allies.
      </p>
      <p>
        These coding challenges will give you a good mix of Python concepts to
        practice, like lists, strings, conditionals, and structures. Depending
        on your experience level, some of these challenges only take a few
        minutes to complete, while the more difficult ones might take a couple
        days. You may want to revisit a Python course to review (we’ve
        recommended the relevant Python courses to try along the way).
      </p>
      <p>
        As you’ll see, these are open-ended challenges and we’re not providing
        solutions. That’s because we want to give you a chance to practice key
        coding skills and apply your coding knowledge to real-world scenarios.
        We hope you feel inspired by all of the ways you can use code to give
        back to the communities and causes that you care about. Happy Pride and
        happy coding!
      </p>

              Write a Python program that takes a user’s pronouns as input and
              returns a message that includes their pronouns and a statement of
              respect for their gender identity. An example of a message could
              be: “Thank you for sharing that your pronouns are {pronouns}. We
              wholeheartedly respect and affirm your gender identity, and
              appreciate your help in building an inclusive environment where
              everyone feels valued and accepted.”

              Create a Python program that takes a list of LGBTQ+ historical
              figures as input and returns a new list with the terms sorted
              alphabetically. Want to brush up on your queer history? Learn

            <td>ASCII Artist</td>
            <td>
              In the beginner-friendly course Learn Python 3, you’ll get
              introduced to ASCII art, a type of text-based visual art that uses
              individual characters to create pictures and diagrams. Write a
              Python program that prints “PRIDE” in ASCII block letters. You can
              reference the complete ASCII alphabet using this chart.

            <td>
              Write a Python program that calculates the number of days, hours,
              and minutes remaining until the annual NYC Pride March, which
              starts on June 25 at 12 pm EDT. The program should display the
              countdown in a user-friendly format. For a refresher on working
              with date time data in Python, read this article.

              Create a switch loop that prints the terms represented in the
              acronym LGBTQ+, which are: lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender,
              queer, and non-straight/non-cisgender identities.

            <td>
              You are given a message, “Code with pride!” that needs to be
              transformed into a rainbow-themed string where each letter is a
              different color in the LGBTQ+ Pride flag. Your task is to write a
              Python function that takes the message as input and returns the
              rainbow version of the message. Hot tip: You can use ANSI escape
              codes to apply color to text in Python.

            <td>
              Develop a simple chatbot that helps you practice using someone’s
              pronouns in different contexts. This code challenge is the most
              advanced one in the bunch, but don’t be intimidated. In the skill
              path Build Chatbots with Python, you’ll learn how to code
              rule-based, retrieval-based, and generative chatbots. The best
              part is you don’t need coding experience to get started — we’ll
              teach you to code with Python from scratch.

            <td>Research LGBTQ+ Representation</td>
            <td>
              Build a program that reads a dataset (you can use this pre-made
              dataset) and analyzes the representation of LGBTQ+ characters in
              cartoons. The program should calculate and display statistics,
              like any trends or changes in representation over the years. If
              you’re new to data science, check out the course Getting Started
              with Python for Data Science. You’ll get to work hands-on with
              real datasets in the course, and learn to use Jupyter Notebook, an
              industry-standard data analytics platform.
